SURVEY:
are the route rate limits too harsh??


REMEMBER:
is x KB enough for body size?
add a mutex lock for frontend api, so everything is processed in sequence
cleanup verification codes from redis if used
send mail for password change and other crucial tasks

SUGGESTION:
add a limit to number of devices where an account can login....
[Not possible] because if someone has too many lost sessions, they cant log back in at all,
[SOLUTION] Every new login remove the oldest session when limit hits
